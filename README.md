# MyWebsite
This is a personal website where I can upload my projects and talk about stuff about me.
Used Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML to make the website for the first phase. 
@TODO
- Porting to Bootstrap 4.4.2 from 3.3.7
- Add personal mouse icon when surfing through website
- Incorporate an actual contact form to the website
- Organize the CSS to one file
- Manage divs classes and id's better since it's very cluttered right now
- Mitigate to JavaScript frameworks such as React.JS
- Add load animation when entering the website
