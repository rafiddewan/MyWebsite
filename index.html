          <h2>Lost. Furious. Embarassed.</h2>
          <p>When I was in high school, I wasn't some outstanding student like the rest of the crowd. My father graduated in Electrical Engineering from Chittagong University in Bangladesh, his GPA was one of the highest in the country and was recognized by the prime minister of Bangladesh. I used to feel shameful that I will never be as good of a student like he was. Choosing enginereing was more so a forced decision at the time since my family kept insisting for me to go into it. By the end of grade 12, I honestly thought my life would go nowhere.

            <h2>Realization. Dream. Hope.</h2>
            <p> However, one person had changed my entire cognition of what seemed to be my doomed future. That person had said "getting into university isn't something to be proud about, what you accomplish in university will show your true quality as an individual." Those words resonated to me one night when it was after prom. I was just staring at my ceiling wondering if my whole life is just going to be me struggling in engineering and then getting a simple  9-to-5 job for the rest of my life. No, I wanted to do much more than that. I realized I wanted to make an impact in this world in some shape or form.

                <h2>Inspire. Determined. Ambitious.</h2>
                <p>My teachers and friends had noticed that I have shown leadership qualities in many moments of my life, but yet I haven't really used them. I realized that I can actually do something with them in the high-tech industry. I always loved both the business aspect and technical aspect of engineering. I have made a long-term goal for myself and that is to become a CEO in the high-tech industry. Regardless how far I get to my goal (or if I even attain it), I will be proud of the expectations I surpassed compared to many. I want to be a CEO just like Elon Musk; someone that has both technical skills and innovative ideas. I made a goal for becoming a recognized individual in my university by getting involved and growing my leadership skills, trying my best to manage grades, and developing fun and useful side projects.

            <h2>Determined. Hardworking. Leadership. Professional.</h2>
            <p>Maybe my GPA doesn't say I'm an A+ student. However, I can say I am a hardworking student with a great work ethic that can easily work within any team environment. I am not afraid to put the effort into it when my superiors ask, and I am always determined for accomplishing my tasks. As I'm diving deeper, and deeper into my program I realized I started to love it more and more. The friendships while being involved with student clubs (such as IEEE Carleton); the professionals I have networked with at networking nights; and the projects I have coded out of pure interest; are all the reasons why I believe that I am in the right program. I can say I have never been happier than where I am currently in life and I know where I want to go. The following sections will show my involvement with the community, some fun facts about me, and the projects I have done and been working on.
